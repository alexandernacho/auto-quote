/**
 * @file Type definition exports index
 * @description 
 * Central export point for all type definitions used in the application.
 * Aggregates and exposes types from various domains (server actions, LLM, UI, etc.)
 * to provide a consistent interface for type imports.
 * 
 * Key features:
 * - Single import source for common types
 * - Organized by functional domains
 * - Prevents circular dependencies
 * 
 * @notes
 * - Import from "@/types" to access all exported types
 * - Add new type modules by creating a new file and exporting it here
